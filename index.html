								<p class="description-title">CS61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
								<p>This course focused mainly on Python, covering computing paradigms like recursion
                                    and object-oriented programming, data structures like linked lists and trees,
                                    and some more advanced topics, including iterators and streams. It also covered
                                    functional programming and relevant topics, such as tail calls, by introducing us
                                    to Scheme, a derivative of Lisp. Finally, it exposed us to declarative programming
                                    by discussing SQL tables, joins, and recursive queries in SQLite.</p>

								<p class="description-title">MATH 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</p>
								<p>The first half of MATH 54 introduced us to fundamental but crucial linear algebra
                                    topics, including linear systems, linear combinations, independence, and
                                    transformations, vector spaces and bases, and eigenvector/values. In the second
                                    half, we moved on to ordinary differential equations of second order and higher
                                    and partial differential equations, which were much more complex and involved
                                    Fourier sine and cosine series.</p>

								<p class="description-title">CS61B: Data Structures and Advanced Programming</p>
                                <p>In this course, with Java as our tool, we intensively analyzed numerous data
                                    structures, including singly and doubly linked lists, array lists, hash tables,
                                    binary search trees (both simple and left-leaning red-and-black trees), queues/stacks,
                                    heaps, and tries. For each data structure, we studied its advantages and disadvantages
                                    in terms of runtime and its methods of implementation. We also went over crucial
                                    algorithms that used these structures, the most notable probably being sorting
                                    methods like mergesort, quicksort, and radix sort. We finished the year by focusing
                                    on graph theory algorithms, like depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's
                                    algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source, and Prim's algorithm for
                                    finding a minimum spanning tree. Some projects we completed included our own local
                                    version control system and an autocomplete program that generated and manipulated
                                    a trie from an inputted dictionary. We primarily used Algorithms, 4th Edition, by
                                    Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.</p>

								<p class="description-title">CS70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</p>
                                <p>This was my hardest but most interesting class this semester! In the first half, we focused on logic,
                                    studying propositions, quantifiers, proof techniques, particularly weak and strong
                                    induction, and graph theory, including Eulerian tours and hypercubes.
                                    We also covered numerous topics relevant to computing, such as RSA security and
                                    its implementation involving an exponential bijection dependent on modular arithmetic,
                                    polynomials and their roles in secret-sharing and error-correcting, and uncomputable
                                    problems, like the famous Halting problem. We moved on to discrete probability in
                                    the second half of the course, starting at basic counting techniques and conditional
                                    probability and moving on to advanced topics, like random variables, Bayes' rule,
                                    Chebyshev's inequality, and several significant distributions, including binomial,
                                    geometric (exponential in continuous probability), Poisson's, and normal.</p>

                                <p class="description-title">CS61C: Machine Structures</p>
                                <p>In contrast to 61A and 61B, CS61C focused on hardware as well as software. The course began with C, as a language that had the least barriers between its own software and the machine's hardware. We studied topics like pointers and memory allocation and made our own version control system using only C. We then dove one level deeper into assembly language, using the MIPS assembly language as our learning tool. We not only programmed in MIPS assembly but also studied in depth the different instruction types (R-type, I-type, J-type) of a 32-bit MIPS machine and the diverse functionalities of the compiler, assembler, linker, and loader. Next, we focused on the actual computer hardware: the datapath and the control. Once again using the MIPS ISA, we learned the limitations of a single-cycle datapath and the benefits--but also resulting hazards--of a pipelined datapath with greater throughput. The course also strongly emphasized the topic of caches; we went over different types of caches, from direct-mapped to fully associative, and spent a great deal of time calculating hit/miss rates for sample code. After caches, we focused on techniques of parallelism, from SIMD vectorized operations and SSE intrinsics to MIMD, where we learned how to effectively use multiple threads with OpenMP in C to obtain unparalleled (haha) speedups, all the while being aware of complications resulting from data races and cache coherency. We also went over MapReduce and WSCs as prime examples of parallelism on a much larger scale. Finally, we discussed some other topics to a lesser degree, such as virtual memory and TLBs, Hamming Code Single Error Correction, and levels of RAID as an efficient organizational schema for secondary memory. Some projects we worked on over the semester include building our own assembler and linker in C and MIPS, building our own datapath + control in Logisim, and running a version of PageRank using MapReduce on Amazon's EC2 servers.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="descriptions" id="170desc">
                                <p class="description-title">CS170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems</p>
                                <p>Another very tough but very interesting and useful class. We ended up going over numerous useful problem-solving techniques throughout the semester, and I definitely think that my ability to analyze a problem and devise algorithms has improved as a result of this class's extremely challenging homework problems. We began by going over divide-and-conquer techniques, highlighting some notable examples such as mergesort, median-finding, and polynomial multiplication in <var>O(n log n)</var> time using the Fast-Fourier Transform. We then moved on to graph theory, covering basic search algorithms like depth-first and breadth-first search and emphasizing the unique properties of directed acyclic graphs, such as linearization. We then went over shortest-path algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford (for the presence of negative edges). After extensive graph theory, we focused on the greedy approach to algorithmic design--taking the immediate most rewarding option without considering the future. Some greedy algorithms highlighted were minimum-spanning-tree algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's and Huffman tree encoding.</p>
                                <p>Next came two heavyweights of algorithmic design: dynamic and linear programming. I absolutely enjoyed dynamic programming because it is able to solve in polynomial time problems that seem, at first glance, tremendously difficult. I loved discovering the recurrence relation for a problem that told me the order in which to solve my subproblems because they were often so simply and elegant yet so very powerful. Some particular problems discussed in class were calculating edit distance and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of points in a graph. Linear programming also came across as extremely powerful. We discussed flow networks and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm used to find the max flow, the concept of the dual LP as a certificate of optimization (in the case of a flow network, the total edge capacity of the minimum cut is precisely the maximum flow possible), and finally, reducing any circuit, and thus any polynomial-time algorithm to a linear program. Linear programming was not as appealing as dynamic programming, though, since we didn't really study how linear programs were actually solved in polynomial time; we instead just devised linear programs and used a linear program solver as a black box.</p>
                                <p>For our last topic, we covered intractable, NP-complete problems with no known polynomial-time algorithm, such as the infamous Traveling Salesman Problem, the satisfiability problem, and the set cover problem. We studied reductions and tackled many questions where we had to reduce an NP-complete problem A to a problem B to prove that B was NP-hard. We discussed that all NP-complete problems were essentially the "same" problem, and that if we could find a polynomial-time algorithm for one of them, we had a polynomial-time algorithm for any problem in NP. Lastly, we went over a couple approximation algorithms for certain NP-complete problems, such as vertex cover, that could approximate the optimal solution to certain factor. In fact, one of our final assignments was a coding project where we had to devise approximation algorithms for a given NP-hard problem, Maximum Acyclic Subgraph (given a directed graph, find the least number of edges to remove that will result in no cycles). Overall a very useful class and a great introduction to theoretical computer science.</p>

                            <div class="descriptions" id="186desc">
                            	<p class="description-title">CS186: Introduction to Database Systems</p>
                            	<p>This course was very comprehensive in its coverage of database systems; we moved from the top layers of conceptual schema design, SQL as a declarative language, and query optimization all the way down to the physical design choices and buffer management strategies behind the scenes. We began the year by discussing external sorting and external hashing as methods to sort/hash data that was too large to fit in memory while minimizing I/O cost. After a subsequent period of focus on the SQL declarative language, we tackled physical database design. We first covered buffer management and page replacement policies, like LRU, MRU, and clock replacement (as a cheaper alternative to LRU). Next, we studied several ways to organize records on pages, such as using bitmap in the page header for fixed-length records and using a slotted directory for variable-length records. Finally we went over indexes as solutions for fast lookup by key. We discussed the tradeoffs between ISAM and B+-Trees, insertion and bulk loading on B+-Trees, and the important differences between clustered and unclustered trees.</p>
                            	<p>After physical design, we moved up a level to query optimization. We learned how to analyze the cost of different join methods, such as page-oriented and block-oriented nested loop joins, index nested loop joins, sort-merge joins, and hash joins. We then optimized query plans through the System R model of cost estimation and dynamic programming, focusing on left-deep plans to minimize the need for materialization of our joins.</p>
                            	<p>Next, we moved on to concurrency control and recovery. We discussed the meaning of ACID transactions and learned to associate atomic and isolated transactions with serializable scheduling of transactions. We used 2-phase locking to guarantee conflict serializability and learned to detect and avoid deadlock situations among transactions. For recovery after a crash, we utilized the steal, no-force ARIES protocol with write-ahead logging, redoing all updates up until the time of the crash and then undoing the updates of all non-committed transactions.</p>
                            	<p>In the last part of the course, we moved to an even higher levels and studied conceptual database design with entity-relationship models. With the help of entity-relationship diagrams, we designed systems with many-to-many, one-to-one, and many-to-one relationships. We also learned about weak entities and the tradeoffs of several competing alternatives in database design, such as binary versus ternary relationships and entities versus attributes. We next learned how to refine database designs and minimize redundancy by taking advantage of functional dependencies and normalization. We utilized Armstrong's axioms and focused on decomposing a single relation into multiple relations of Boyce-Codd normal form (all functional dependencies within a relation are determined by keys of that relation), in a way that would guarantee lossless joins.</p>
                            	<p>Projects in this class often involved using Pyspark for big data processing on RDDs. Some interesting assignments we had included coding our own strict 2-phase locking system and implementing K-means clustering through Pyspark to group together committee locations of the 2016 presidential candidates.</p>

                            	<p class="description-title">CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</p>
                            	<p>I'm glad I took this course because it introduced me to many stimulating and unfamiliar topics in AI. We started off with basic concepts, such as state spaces, search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems (solved with arc consistency techniques), and minimax/expectimax game trees (optimized with alpha-beta pruning). We then moved on to learn about Markov Decision Processes and, more importantly, reinforcement learning, where the agent learns about its environment online rather than offline. We practiced techniques like Q-learning to extract the optimal policy for an agent in a particular environment. (Personally, this section of reinforcement learning was my favorite part of the course.)</p>
                            	<p>In the second half of the course, we moved on to probability. We learned about conditional probability and Bayes Nets, and how these directed acyclic graphs could be used to represent the joint probability distribution of numerous random variables. We also practiced inference-- making queries about the probability of certain variables given some evidence and some hidden variables--through variable elimination as an exact method and sampling techniques (likelihood weighting, Gibbs sampling) as approximate, less costly methods. Next, we covered Markov chains and hidden Markov models as representations of how the hidden state of an environment could be tracked with a transition model and observations at each time step. We ended the course with an introduction to machine learning and some of its fundamental components, including perceptrons to classify training data, multi-layer neural networks for deep learning of features, and gradient descent on the parameters of our model to minimize our training loss.</p>

								<p>Independent Project</p>
								<p>Skills: Node/Express.js, Socket.IO, Mongoose for MongoDB database</p>
								<p><a href="https://glacial-retreat-7884.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Contact</a> is a real-time chatting web application. It has an authentication system: users of the site can log in and chat with other users in chatrooms. Chatrooms can be customized in several aspects, like privacy and maximum capacity. Also, users can invite other users to their chatrooms and request to join different public chatrooms. They receive notifications about invites and requests in real time.</p>
								<p>This project was a way for me to become familiar with not only Node.js and its asynchronous style of programming but also other components of the MEAN stack. Indeed, I ended up using MongoDB (employing Mongoose.js as an object modeler) for my application's database and Express.js for its backend. I was pretty amazed to see that I could develop an entire web application, both front-end and back-end, with only JavaScript. All the components of the app, from database queries to browser scripts, ended up fitting so smoothly that I would sometimes forget which layer I was working on. I was also impressed with Socket.IO, the engine that allowed me to incorporate real-time messaging into my application. Before I found Socket.IO, I was weighing the implementation complexities of other real-time options, like long polling and WebSockets. Fortunately, Socket.IO's simple API allowed me to focus on the business logic behind real-time messaging and notifications and provided me with useful capabilities like broadcasting to multiple sockets. I didn't have to worry about when I should use long polling, when I should use WebSockets, etc.</p>
								<p>Probably the most challenging aspect of this project was designing schemas for Mongoose models that correspond to MongoDB collections. Many of my collections had relationships that may have been easier to implement with a relational database and a framework like, say, Django. For example, Users and Chatrooms had a many-to-many relationship. I spent much of my time thinking about how I could maintain coherency between related users and chatrooms (which became more complicated when requests and invites came into the picture) with as few necessary queries as possible. Finally, for better performance, I wanted the browser to store only a limited number of chat messages and the user to be able to load previous messages. To accomplish this, I had to work on design a schema for saving chat messages to the database in equally sized chunks.</p>
								<p>This project isn't completely finished. Some of my next steps include writing tests for my middleware and improving the application's UI.</p>

	                                    a Django-powered project I undertook to get familiar with the Django
	                                    framework and learn about the functionality it offered, as well as get experience with designing user interfaces with Bootstrap and JavaScript/jQuery. It's a simple website
	                                    built off the Django tutorial that lets registered members make their own polls
	                                    and vote on other member's polls. Pollsite is composed of two applications: a
	                                    basic user authentication application and a voting application that processes users'
	                                    votes as well as their creation and removal of polls through a dynamic UI. This project definitely accustomed me
	                                    to Django's model-view-template system, as well as several other Django and general
	                                    web development paradigms, like always remembering to persist changes to
	                                    models' attributes to the database and returning an HTTPResponseRedirect after
	                                    changing server data. It also made me appreciate how easy database-backed web
	                                    development was with Django, which did all the SQL work for me.</p>

                                <p>Classroom Project (CS61B, Spring 2015)</p>
                                <p>Technologies: Java</p>
                                <p>
                                    Gitlet was one of the main projects students completed in CS61B. Using only Java and
                                    its standard libraries, we were asked to design and implement our local version
                                    control system. The system would have many of Git's commands (hence the name Gitlet),
                                    including add, remove, commit, checkout, branch, merge, and rebase. This project was
                                    significant because unlike earlier assignments, we were given no starter code from
                                    the course instructors. I ended up learning and implementing some invaluable
                                    functionalities, such as copying and comparing files using byte streams and saving
                                    the state of Java objects with the Serializable interface. In addition, since each
                                    operation we needed to complete came with time and space requirements, and since
                                    61B was all about data structures, my Gitlet ended up being heavily dependent on
                                    how I designed my objects. For example, I ended up modeling my branches after singly
                                    linked lists, with the nodes being Commit objects, so that I could perform operations
                                    like log, checkout, and merge as efficiently as possible.
                                </p>

								<p class="description-title">Scheme Interpreter</p>
								<p>Classroom Project (CS61A, Fall 2014)</p>
								<p>Technologies: Python</p>
								<p>For the last project in CS61A, we were asked to build an interpreter in Python for
                                    Scheme, a dialect of the Lisp functional programming language. I worked with a
                                    partner to implement Scheme in all of its parenthetical glory; we ended up with
                                    a nice interpreter that could do basic arithmetic, define variables, Scheme
                                    pairs, and Scheme lists, create and call lambda procedures with both lexical and
                                    dynamic scope(in which case we called them Mu procedures), and carry out Scheme
                                    special forms, like if, begin, cond, let, and quote (it's pretty unique how you
                                    can manipulate the Scheme language itself). I think this project was the most
                                    instructive out of our 61A projects; I learned a great deal about the important
                                    process of making your own interpreter. I learned how to parse user input using
                                    lexical and syntactic analysis; in this project, for example, we converted the
                                    input into Linked List instances. And I learned about the mutually recursive
                                    processes of evaluation and application: evaluating something requires applying
                                    the operator to the operands, and applying a procedure requires evaluating the
                                    procedure's body in a local frame.</p>

                    		<p>May 2016 - August 2016</p>
                    		<p>Skills: React.js, jQuery, JavaServer Pages, Java</p>
                    			<p>I interned for Glassdoor's core team and acquisitions team, completing projects under the company's lead web developers. My main stories involved front-end refactoring, transforming common UI features of the Glassdoor website into React.js components that are modular and reusable anywhere on the site. I coded and tested two major components that currently in production: Glassdoor's ubiquitous dropdown menus and its similarly widespread employer photo carousels. </p>
                    			<p>In addition to my React work, I also completed an interesting company infrastructure project. To streamline web app builds and patches, I moved static files out of the normal build and into their own repository. I created a Gulp task that lets web developers upload updated static files to an Amazon S3 bucket, which would service the web app's front end. I also wrote another task that generates a manifest of all static files, mapping each file's URI to a hash string used for cachebusting. In addition to JavaScript, this project involved a fair amount of Java; I needed to rewrite the back end to retrieve static resources from the new S3 bucket and use the manifest's cachebuster strings. This infrastructural move was crucial for productivity, as it allowed back-end engineers to iterate without worrying about unstable static files affecting their development and front-end engineers to patch static files without re-building everything.</p>
                    			<p>Finally, I worked on various bug fixes and smaller stories for teams that needed an extra developer for a sprint. One mini-project that I found to be especially significant was a redesigning of the site's login/locked-content modules (i.e., "Sign up or sign in now to get access to all of Glassdoor"). This assignment was not difficult; I simply needed to modify several JSPs and Sass files to make the site use the new version of the modules. However, I found out after the changes went to production that overall user registration increased by about 5%.</p>
                    			<p>Seeing my changes go live and actually impact the outside world was definitely the most rewarding aspect of my internship. It was something that I didn't experience with Coverity, whose products were used by other businesses and not publicly available. I also learned a great deal more about developing and testing in an agile environment, including working in 2-week sprints, using semantic versioning when updating dependencies, submitting pull requests to merge feature branches into release branches, and testing in a separate QA environment. And of course, I learned a tremendous amount of JavaScript, like coding in ES6 syntax and using Babel to compile it, using powerful tools like React and Redux, and testing with frameworks and libraries like Mocha and expect.js. Overall another valuable summer. </p>

                                <p>As a technical intern for Coverity's Test Advisor dev team (the Test Advisor, or TA, is
                                a static analysis tool for Java, .NET, and C++ that determines how well a a code project's
                                classes and methods are covered by its tests), I worked primarily on the Business Modeler
                                component. The Business Modeler is a web application that allows a user to create a visual
                                representation of his/her code project by mapping classes to physical containers, or modules, on the
                                screen. These modules can be renamed, added, removed, and even nested, and the overall
                                layout of the model a user creates can be geometrically re-adjusted by dragging and dropping
                                modules. In addition, the user can access metrics like the percentage of classes mapped
                                for a package in his/her project code tree and the percentage of classes covered by
                                tests for a particular module. With a visual organized model, he/she gets a clearer picture
                                of which functionalities of the project are covered, modified, etc.</p>
                                <p>Coverity had an old Business Modeler, but its UI was written in Flex and considered to be
                                outdated. I worked on revamping the front-end with primarily JavaScript and jQuery and
                                little dependence on third-party frameworks. In addition, I implemented API services in
                                Java for the back-end server, which was written using the Dropwizard
                                <a href="http://www.dropwizard.io/" target="_blank"></a> framework. One of the greatest
                                challenges I had on the front-end was designing algorithms for geometrically restructuring
                                a model's layout after the user moves a module to another location, which ultimately
                                involved determining which modules were in the moved module's width or height span and
                                multiplying their physical dimensions by an appropriate ratio. Another challenge was
                                constantly thinking about the trade-offs between performance and space; for example, I
                                didn't want to store all of a project's classes on the client side because we could be
                                dealing with a project with thousands of classes. This meant that I had to create smart
                                back-end services and front-end data structures that would still allow me to do things like
                                keeping track of percentage of classes mapped.</p>
                                <p>Overall, I had a fantastic time at Coverity. I learned a great deal about JavaScript and the
                                full chain of a web application, from connecting the front-end via AJAX to the server to
                                making useful API services by persisting and retrieving data to and from the database. And
                                I definitely couldn't have made as much out of this internship without the help and advice
                                I received from my dev team mentors.</p>
